# **Project Plan -- Team69**

>## **1 Introduction**

In order to improve student's essay writing skills, we are creating a program that tracks the number of words appeared in a sentence. Based on the total number of words, the program will evaluate the essay and make recommendation if the number of the words exceeded the requirement.  

>## **2 Process Description**

The process of this project will be constructed by using waterfall model. 

>>### **2.1 Collect requirements**
Customer requirements are collected through interview with customer. Questions will be asked to clarify requirements. We will ask customer for two or three sample essay files with different definition of ending sentence delimiters and with different special words (I'm, 2.0 and 1,234, etc.) and expected results. Minimum 3 letters will be considered a word. Based on customer's answers, requirement documents and/or project plan will be modified to reflect understanding of the project team. Once we get customer's answers and requirements, documentation will be finalized. 

>>### **2.2 Define Project Plan**
Draft project description, create tasks, select team members and define their roles. 
The project plan needs to be approved by each team member as well as the busieness stakeholders. Each team member will commit the project plan at Github to approve the file. Once every team member approved, the project plan would be finalized. 

>>### **2.3 Draft requirement documentation**
Create technical requirements based on business needs and end users recommendation. 
The requirement documentation needs to be approved by each team member and it also needs to be version controlled with Github. All team members' commits are needed to finalize the documentation. 

>>### **2.4 Develop project plan**
Write code to implement target function. The program will perform the following functions, prompt user to input directory and file name, read essay file, slide file into sentences based on delimiters, count words in each sentence, calculate average words, give comments or recommendations. Revise the program to make sure all customer's requirements are performed. The program needs to be proofread by each team member and it also needs to be version controlled with Github. Every team member needs to commit and approved the final version of program to finalize the development.

>>### **2.5 Test program**
Design test plan and write testing code. Run manually and automatically testing. Make sure all expectations are satisfied. The testing process needs to be approved by each team member and the test results needs to be committed with Github. All tests designed and testing code need to pass to finalize this process.     

>>### **2.6 Write instruction**
To make sure students at distinct technique level are able to use the program properly, a complete instruction will be provided. The instruction includes how to start the program, how to input file name of essay, how to use optional flag for more delimiters. The instruction needs to be proofread by each team member and needs to be version controlled with Github. Every team member needs to commit and approve the final version of instruction to finalize the project.

>>### **3.3 Role assignment for team members**

| Team member        | Roles              |
| :----------------- | :----------------- |
| Jie Yang           | Project Manager    |
| Eric Zollinger     | Documentation Lead |
| Huihui Duan        | Development Lead, tester   |
| Hui Gao            | QA Manager, developer, tester         |

>## **4 Estimates**

>>### **4.1 Effort hours**
Each team member will spend 2 hours per week for this 2-week project. (2 hours/week x 2 weeks) = 4 hours for each team-member. We have 5 team members, so total 20 hours will be expected to spend on the project.

>>### **4.2 Lines of code**
Based on the features of the program and coding language we are using, around 300 lines of code would be expected to have in our final product.
